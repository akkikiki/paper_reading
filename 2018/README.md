## Cheap Translation for Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition, EMNLP 2017
* http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1269
### What is interesting about this paper?
* Explored how to use cross-lingual embeddings in the downstream task (Common space vs. hard mapping of vectors), only on cross-lingual CCA though

## Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling, COLING 2018
* http://aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139
### What is interesting about this paper?
* Character-level language model for predicting the next character

## A Discriminative Latent-Variable Model for Bilingual Lexicon Induction, EMNLP 2018
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09334
### What is interesting about this paper?
* Enforcing 1:1 matiching for some subset of tranlsations

## Neural Cross-Lingual Named Entity Recognition with Minimal Resources, EMNLP 2018
* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09861.pdf
### What is interesting about this paper?
* Explored how to use cross-lingual embeddings in the downstream task (Common space vs. hard mapping of vectors)
* Used self-attention to ameliorate the problem of different word-order across langauges
